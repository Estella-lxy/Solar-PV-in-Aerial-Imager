# Solar-PV-in-Aerial-Imager

This a dataset of color aerial imagery collected over the US city of Fresno, California. The full imagery dataset is composed of 2008 images that are each 101 pixels wide, 101 pixels tall and made up of three color channels Red, Green and Blue. Therefore, each image consists of 101 × 101 × 3 numbers and each number is an integer that ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (while). The full dataset has been divided into a training set and testing set. There are 1500 images in training set and the remaining 558 images are in the testing set. 

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning technique that is able to make a binary decision: is there a solar panel in the image?
